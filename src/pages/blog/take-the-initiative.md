If you are waiting for something to be initiated, chances are high that others
are as well!

For months have I been reading IndieHackers (IH), but haven‚Äôt connected with
anyone offline that have the spirit as all online IH readers.

Weekly I was scrolling through their newsletter hoping for a meetup in
Copenhagen to be arranged, but it never appeared.

So I reached out to the 30 people on the platform with Copenhagen in their
profile to hear if they were interested.

And it was the easiest cold mailing I have done in my life! It turned out that
many others have been

Of the 30 people, 20 people responded positively & 10 awesome Indie Hackers
showed up on the day.

### Preparation

I had no experience arranging meetups or anything, but the group made it easy.

When reaching out initially, a few guys offered their office space to host the
event if necessary. All I did was gathering all the interested people in an
Airtable & creating a Google Calendar event to send out to all of them.

Then I applied to become an [Indie Hackers community
ambassador](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/become-a-community-ambassador-and-bring-together-indie-hackers-in-your-city-1bb1b13a05)
which gave me access to a Slack channel where other ambassadors & Courtland
shared their experiences.

Based on that I noted down an idea for an agenda & waited for Tuesday to arrive.

## The Meetup

When we all met I quickly realized this was the exact group of people I‚Äôd love
to build with. They were all so damn different! In their personality, in what
they worked with, in their approach to business, in everything (in a good way
üòÇ).

There was a handful of nationalities gathered and projects ranging from Virtual
Assistant as a Service to Agile Products to Analytic Services to eCommerce
stores and more.

For this meetup, I decided to talk about my 2 current projects:

- [Infinite Climbing](https://infiniteclimbing.netlify.com/) (AR climbing app),
- Scan2Sheet (Inventory Management System).

I got good ideas on how to hack my way to track own hands while climbing for the
AR game by mounting a Leap Motion device to the headset. For the second I got an
idea to integrate into another popular application ‚Äî something I had never
thought about before but that could potentially be a great lever for growth.

At the meetup people offered their office‚Äôs recording studio for someone else to
record content for the course he had been planning, one guy wanted to get some
last people‚Äôs feedback on an idea before he closed it down completely, and much
more.

So many things that wouldn‚Äôt have happened if I had not gathered these people.

Onwards will the meetups be held through Typeform (copied idea & text from the
Barcelona chapter ‚Äî forgive me! üôè):

#1 Who do you want to gather?

Now seeing the people introducing themselves in the Slack group we have created
& posting links to their projects is just another benefit of this. Everybody is
really working on beautiful & functioning products, which really pushes me to
set the bar higher for my projects.

_(I am Danish so I don‚Äôt want to say that it was the absolute most amazing
experience ever to happen in the history of the universe, but I am sure good
things will come out of this!)_

Let's see where this take us over the next months.

I hope this serves as inspiration for you to arrange your own thing or take
initiative on x instead of waiting for it to appear.
