Doing anything noteworthy by yourself is close to impossible. When we see people
who have created incredible services, it is often built from the input of
hundreds.

### Making Stone Soup

This is the idea of making stone soup, a concept from [Peter
Diamandis](https://medium.com/@PeterDiamandis) book BOLD. Boiled down (pun
intended), the story is about how you make something from nothing by reaching
out to others and make them excited about your idea. [It is worth a quick 2
minute read.](https://www.diamandis.com/blog/stone-soup)

I am still surprised how I got the confidence to [crowdfund 10k for building
sports facilities for a school in
Nicaragua](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lpXoREGyEQ), but looking back I
believe it was the feedback from the collaborative social innovation network
[Babele](https://babele.co/) (thanks again, [Emanuele
Musa](https://medium.com/@emanuele.musa)!)

We are not all surrounded by the people who can give the right input to make our
dreams a reality. But somewhere in the world, there are people that are willing
to help you scale your ideas.

It is on based on this idea that the immensely inspirational [Daniel
Gross](https://medium.com/@danielgross) created Pioneer.

### How Pioneer helped me

Pioneer is an open global community for creative young people working on
interesting projects.

- You can apply with anything. Your research, a company, art, everything.
- Every week you submit a status update on what you are working on, how you
  progressed since last week & what you will achieve next week.
- Based on this, 20 peers from the community upvotes or downvotes you compared to
  another random project on the platform.
- After that, you get a mail with feedback from the users who have voted on you
  and with information on how many points you have gotten. Every week for 1 month.

#### Accountability

My brain is not always rational. I can get myself to do many things, but having
weekly goals apparently kept me to another level of accountability.

Knowing that a group of people will see if I actually do what I set out to do
was weirdly motivating.

Besides just getting something done, the community pushed me to get the right
things done. When I was reading and voting on other applicants, I also got
motivated & inspired to do specific things. Reading about others testing their
MVP with users or pitching their ideas to organizations pushed me to overcome my
fear and do that as well.

#### Weekly feedback.

The feedback was good, but not enough. However, it inspired me to seek out more
feedback.

One incredibly valuable interaction I had was with one of the previous Pioneer
winners that I reached out to on Twitter.

After weeks of getting feedback saying my idea was great and all, finally
somebody gave honest useful critical feedback.

Of course, it hurt at first. Looking at my site I did understand him though. If
a complete stranger landed on my page, they wouldn’t have understood exactly
what it was about.

One day of interaction with him I learned more about communicating clearly than
I had in a long time.

Life is really too short to not give people the right harsh feedback their
projects deserve.

In week 3, they surprised and gave all in top 75 access to a Board of Advisors
of our choosing. I chose:

- [Dylan Field](https://medium.com/@zoink) — CEO of Figma — for his eye for
  design.
- [Star Simpson](https://medium.com/@starsandrobots) — CEO of CorvidAir — for her
  maker spirit and inspiring [portfolio of unusual interesting
  projects.](http://starsimpson.com/)
- [Ben Reinhardt](https://medium.com/@Ben_Reinhardt) — Entrepreneur In Residence
  at Susa Ventures — for his previous experience with AI & AR at Magic Leap.

.. These are not the type of people I usually have access to if you are
wondering!

I want to highlight especially an email exchange I had with Star Simpson that
made me rethink what the entire idea could become and how I should think about
my users.

Daniel Gross is definitely achieving his goal with Pioneer of guiding aspiring
entrepreneurs and nurturing their minds.

The power of community is incredible. Winning the tournament would be an extra
benefit, but being a part of this community for the last month has helped me
turn my idea from a mere dream into something I actually believe in.

In a post about why Pioneer was founded, Daniel highlights how important it was
for him in his journey to have someone actually believing in you. When you feel
that people believe in you, you get inspired to make things happen.

Finding Pioneer has reenergized me to seek out the communities I need to make
the life I want a reality.
