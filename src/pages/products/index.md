  As an aspiring entrepreneur have I been a part of projects in various areas .
  Hopefully in the future I will be able to connect the dots looking backwards
  and see a perfect trajectory towards something amazing - but for now it is
  kinda messy.

    PinoleroGO. During month 1-3 I build upon the idea, validated the idea in
    the village, reached out to my network on how to do this & read everything I
    could about it. The next month was spent preparing the crowdfunding
    campaign. Month 4 was a constant effort to reach out to as many as possible.
    Thanks to hundreds of kind souls we had the money 3 days before our
    all-or-nothing campaign deadline, so the last month was spent building. This
    was the outcome..
